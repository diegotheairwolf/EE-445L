// negative logic switches connected to PF0 and PF4 on the Launchpad

// blue LED connected to PF2 on the Launchpad
// green LED connected to PF3 on the Launchpad
// NOTE: The NMI (non-maskable interrupt) is on PF0.  That means that
// the Alternate Function Select, Pull-Up Resistor, Pull-Down Resistor,
// and Digital Enable are all locked for PF0 until a value of 0x4C4F434B
// is written to the Port F GPIO Lock Register.  After Port F is
// unlocked, bit 0 of the Port F GPIO Commit Register must be set to
// allow access to PF0's control registers.  On the LM4F120, the other
// bits of the Port F GPIO Commit Register are hard-wired to 1, meaning
// that the rest of Port F can always be freely re-configured at any
// time.  Requiring this procedure makes it unlikely to accidentally
// re-configure the JTAG pins as GPIO, which can lock the debugger out
// of the processor and make it permanently unable to be debugged or
// re-programmed.
